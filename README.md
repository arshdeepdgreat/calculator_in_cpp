# calculator_in_cpp
a basic c++ calculator with 7 choices ...also a zen mode basically in which you enter space separated expressions and evaluate the answer
some examples "5 + 4" and the answer will come as 9 
then a newline gets printed 
also the program doesnt end unless you go to normal mode and enter a number other than 1-7
